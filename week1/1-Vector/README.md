# Vector

Implement the `Vector` data structure in [Java](Vector.java), [Python](vector.py)
or [C++](vector.cpp). The `Vector` should not be limited in capacity. It should
expand if there is not enough space to accomodate insertions. It should support
the `insert`, `add`, `get`, `remove`, `pop`, `size` and `capacity` operations.
