# Queue

You have the `List` data structure at your disposal. Using only it implement
the `Queue` data structure in [Java](Queue.java), [Python](queue.py)
or [C++](queue.cpp). The `Queue` should not be limited in capacity. It should
expand if there is not enough space to accomodate insertions. It should support
the `push`, `pop`, `peek` and `size` operations.
