# Stack

You have the `Queue` data structure at your disposal. Using only it implement
the `Stack` data structure in [Java](Stack.java), [Python](stack.py)
or [C++](stack.cpp). The `Stack` should not be limited in capacity. It should
expand if there is not enough space to accomodate insertions. It should support
the `push`, `pop`, `peek` and `size` operations.
